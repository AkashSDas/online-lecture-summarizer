# online_lecture_summarizer

### 🌈 Problems this app solves
  - With the 🚀 increase in online lectures in schools and colleges the process of learning has become very easy.
  - But this brings some new challenges such as 
    - __if a student has missed  lectures then what❓__
    - __what if a student want to know what has happened in _x_ lecture❓__
  - Surely these problems were there even before online lectures came into play, but now most of these institutes are 🎥 recording their online lectures in video format which solves most of the problems mentioned above
  - But the above solutions brings new **challenges** in front of 👨‍🎓 **students** and these 🏛 **institutes** such as:
    - ❌ If a student wants to know what has happened in _x_ lecture then he/she has to go through that entire **long lecture** which will make him/her 😩 **tiresome**.
    - ❌ If a student is absent then he/she has to watch the long videos to get know what has happened and this is very ⏳ **time consuming**.
    - ❌ Also storing so many videos in a database is 💸 **quite expensive**
  - The 🔥 **Online Lecture Summarizer** solves all of these problems
	  - It's a **CLI app** which records the audio of the entire lecture and creates the **transcript file** of that lecture and then uses an 🤖 **AI** to **create the summary** of that transcript file which is saved in a text file.
	  - Students can use the CLI to **convert** summary's **text to audio** and then can listen to that
	  - Students can also listen to entire lectures by converting the transcript file to audio using the CLI.
- Using Online Lecture Summarizer
	- ✅ Students can get summary of the entire lecture of any day very **easily**.
	- ✅ Students who has missed the lectures, by reading/listening to the summary can create a plan _on which topics to should I focus❓_ and by this they will  **save a lot of time**.
	- ✅ Learning institutes will **save a lot of money** by using this because now they only have to save the text files.
