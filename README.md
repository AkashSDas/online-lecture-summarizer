### Problems this app solves
  - With the 🚀 increase in online lectures in schools and colleges the process of learning has become very easy.
  - But this brings some new challenges such as 
    - __if a student has missed  lectures then what?__
    - __what if a student want to know what has happened in _x_ lecture?__
  - Surely these problems were there even before online lectures came into play, but now most of these institutes are recording their online lectures in video format which solves most of the problems mentioned above
  - But the above solutions brings new **challenges** in front of **students** and these **institutes** such as:
    - If a student wants to know what has happened in _x_ lecture then he/she has to go through that entire **long lecture** which will make him/her 😩 **tiresome**.
    - If a student is absent then he/she has to watch the long videos to get know what has happened and this is very ⏳ **time consuming**.
    - Also storing so many videos in a database is 💸 **quite expensive**
- The **Online Lecture Summarizer** solves all of these problems
	  - It's a **CLI app** which records the audio of the entire lecture and creates the **transcript file** of that lecture and then uses an 🤖 **AI** to **create the summary** of that transcript file which is saved in a text file.
	  - Students can use the CLI to **convert** summary's **text to audio** and then can listen to that
	  - Students can also listen to entire lectures by converting the transcript file to audio using the CLI.
- Using Online Lecture Summarizer
	- ✅ Students can get summary of the entire lecture of any day very **easily**.
	- ✅ Students who has missed the lectures, by reading/listening to the summary can create a plan _on which topics to should I focus?_ and by this they will  **save a lot of time**.
	- ✅ Learning institutes will **save a lot of money** by using this because now they only have to save the text files.
